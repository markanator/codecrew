## A full stack TypeScript social platform

I recently had access to [@TraversyMedia](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb)'s [Mern Stack Front-2-Back React & Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/) course and opted to challenge myself by following along while only using TypeScript on both the Front End and Back End.

## [Follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/_mark_ambro)

## Tech Used

#### Front End

- Next.js for presentation layer
- Redux / @redux-toolkit for state management
- React-Hook-Form for form state managment
- Dayjs for date formatting
- React-Icons for... icons. ;)
- Css for styles

#### Back End

- Express.js for a RESTful API
- MongoDB for persistant data
- Mongoose for object document modeling and etc..
- Express-Validator for input validation
- Argon2 for password hashing
- JWT for authentication
- Cors / Helmet to beef up security ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

### Future Goals

- Perhaps use a component library to add better polish
- work out wrinkles left over from original course
- Swap out redux for react-query & immer
- perhaps use next-auth for authentication
